\subsection{Open Platform League}
\label{sec:rules:robotappearance_opl}
Robots competing in the \OPL{} must comply with security specifications in order to avoid causing any harm while operating.

\subsubsection{Size and Weight}
\label{sec:rules:robotappearance_opl:size}

\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Dimensions:} The dimensions of a robot should not exceed the limits of an average door (\SI{200}{\centi\meter} by \SI{70}{\centi\meter}). The \TC{} may allow the qualification and registration of larger robots, but it cannot be guaranteed that the robots can actually enter the arena. In doubt, contact the \LOC{}.
\end{itemize}


\noindent\textbf{Note:} All robot requirements will be tested during \RobotInspection{} (see~\ref{sec:setupdays:inspection}).
