\section{External Devices}
\label{sec:rules:externaldevices}
Everything a team uses in a test that is not part of the robot is considered an \ExternalDevice{}.
An \ExternalDevice{} must be authorized by the \TC{} during \RobotInspection{} (see~\ref{sec:setupdays:inspection}).
The \abb{TC} decides whether an \ExternalDevice{} can be used freely or under referee supervision and determines its impact on scoring.

% On-line devices
\subsection{On-Line External Computing}
\label{sec:rules:onlineexternalcomputing}
Teams can utilize \ExternalComputing{} through the internet connection of the \ArenaNetwork{} (e.g.~cloud services, online APIs). These must be announced to and approved by the \TC{} one month prior to the competition.
