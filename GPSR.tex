\section{GPSR}

This test evaluates Human-Robot Interaction and the integration of the abilities of the robot tested in stage I. In this test the robot has to solve multiple tasks upon request. That is, the test is not incorporated into a (predefined) story and there is neither a predefined order of tasks nor a predefined set of actions. The actions that are to be carried out by the robot are randomly generated by the referees and are composed by 3 subtasks which include navigation, human-robot interaction and robot-object interaction.

The command is composed by three actions, which the robot has to
show it has recognized. The robot may repeat the understood command and ask for confirmation. If it can't recognize the command correctly, it can also ask the speaker to repeat the complete command.

\subsection{Focus}
This test particularly focuses on the following aspects:
\begin{itemize}
\item No predefined order of actions to carry out (to get away from state machine-like behavior programming).
\item Increased complexity in speech recognition.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Task}

\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Entering and command retrieval:} The robot enters the arena and drives to a designated position where it has to wait for further commands.
\item \textbf{Command generation:} A command is generated randomly. The command must contain at least one of each of the following components
\begin{itemize}
\item Navigation (robot will need to move somewhere else).
\item Human-robot interaction (such as: people detection, recognition, and tracking; online training, answering predefined questions).
\item Robot-Object interaction (such as: object detection, object recognition, and object manipulation).
\end{itemize}
The command is composed by three actions, which the robot has to show it has recognized. The robot may repeat the understood command and ask for confirmation. If it can't recognize the command correctly, it can also ask the speaker to repeat the complete command. If the robot fails to understand the given commands, it may ask to the operator to repeat them up to three times, if it fails the team may opt to use the Continue rule (Section \refsec{rule:asrcontinue}). In case the robot has understood partially the command, it may ask the operator for additional information (e.g.~\quotes{did you say apple juice or orange juice?}).
\item \textbf{Task assignment:} The robot is given the command by the operator and may directly start to work on the task assignment.
\item \textbf{Exiting the arena:} After accomplishing the assigned task, the robot has to leave the arena.
\end{enumerate}

\paragraph{Command examples}
\begin{itemize}
\item Go to the bedroom, find a person and tell the time (missing object-interaction part).
\item Go to the kitchen, find a person and follow her to the livingroom (missing object-interaction part).
\item Go to the dinner-table, grasp the crackers, and put them on the tv-table.
\item Go to the shelf, count the drinks and report to me.
\item Take this object and bring it to Susan at the hall.
\item Bring a coke to the person in the living room and answer his question.
% \item Bring me the crackers to the TV.
\item Take a drink from the kitchentable and offer it to the person at the entrance.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Additional rules and remarks}
\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Referees:} Since the score system in this test involves a subjective evaluation of the robot's behavior, the referees are EC/TC members.
\item \textbf{Operator:}
\begin{itemize}
\item The person operating the robot is one of the referees (default operator).
\item If the robot appears to consistently not be able to understand the operator, the referees ask the team to continue with a custom operator (Section \refsec{rule:operator}).
\item With the custom operator, the team can only score 50\% of the points for the respective command.
\end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Referee and OC instructions}
\textbf{h before test:}
\begin{itemize}
\item Specify and announce the entrance and exit door
\end{itemize}
\textbf{During the test:}
\begin{itemize}
\item Generate random sentences by an automatic sentence generator
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Score sheet}
The maximum time for this test is 8 minutes.
