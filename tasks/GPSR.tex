\section{General Purpose Service Robot [Housekeeper]}
\label{test:gpsr}
The robot can be asked to do anything involving abilities required in Stage~I of this rulebook.

% \subsection*{Focus}
% This test focuses on the detection and recognition of objects and their features, as well as object manipulation.

\subsection*{Main Goal}
Execute 3 commands requested by the operator.

\noindent\textbf{Reward:} 750pts (250 points per command)\\

\subsection*{Bonus rewards}
\begin{enumerate}[nosep]
	\item Understand a command given by naive operator (50pts, each).
	\item Autonomously leaving the arena (100pts).
\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{Setup}
\begin{enumerate}[nosep]
	\item \textbf{Location:} The task mostly takes place inside the arena (some commands might require the robot to go outside).

	\item \textbf{Operators:} A \emph{professional operator} (i.e.~the referee) commands the robot to execute a task.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{Additional rules and remarks}
\begin{enumerate}[nosep]
	\item \textbf{Command Generator:} Tasks will be generated using the official \emph{GPSR Command Generator} available 2 months prior to the competition in the official repository.

	\item \textbf{Naive Operators:} Optionally, commands can be issued by a \emph{Naive Operator}, i.e.~a person from the audience with no background in robotics. The referee gives the command to the \emph{Naive Operator}, who will then issue it to the robot (rephrasing is allowed). If the robot consistently fails to understand the naive operator (e.g.~3 times or more), teams can default to a custom operator.

	\item \textbf{Deus ex Machina:} Score reduction applies per given command as follows:
	\begin{itemize}[nosep]
	\item \textbf{Custom operator:} Providing a custom operator causes 50pts score reduction.
	\item \textbf{Further assistance:} Helping a robot to accomplish a task causes a score reduction in line with \ref{rule:continue_scoring}.
	\item \textbf{Bypassing commands:} A robot instructing a human assistant on how to accomplish the whole task receives no points for the command.
	\end{itemize}

	\item \textbf{Instruction Point:} At the beginning of the test, and after finishing the first and second command, the robot moves back to the \textit{Instruction Point}.

	\item \textbf{Leaving the arena:} A bonus scoring of 100pts can be earned if the robot autonomously leaves the arena after successfully  executing (achieve a non-zero score) all three given commands.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{OC instructions}
\textbf{2 hours before the test}
\begin{itemize}[nosep]
	\item Generate commands for the robots.
	\item Announce the location of the instruction point.
	\item Recruit volunteers to assist during the test.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Referee instructions}
\begin{itemize}[nosep]
	\item Provide the commands to the operators.
	\item Make sure arena is in normal condition.
\end{itemize}
