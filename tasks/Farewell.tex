\section{Farewell [Party Host]}
The robot helps guests to reach to the cab waiting outside.

\subsection{Main Goal}
Robot guides the guest who wants to leave to the cab and carries his/her bag if requested.

\noindent\textbf{Reward:} 500 pts for helping the first guest.

\subsection{Bonus rewards}
\begin{enumerate}[nosep]
	\item Identifying the female calling person and escorting her first (100 pts).
	\item Guiding the second guest to the cab (400 pts).
\end{enumerate}


\subsection{Setup}
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Location}: The test takes place inside and outside the arena.
	%Guests are in the living room.

	\item \textbf{Start Location}: The robot starts inside the arena at a predefined location near the entrance door.

	\item \textbf{Guests}: Initially there are five people in the living room, three sitting and two standing.
	At least two guests are female.
	%Two guests have a bag assigned.

	\item \textbf{Calling guests:} Only two guests are willing to leave who have a bag assigned. Both guests, male and female, will call the robot by waving or shouting at the same time.
	
	\item \textbf{Request to Carry Bag:} Only the guest leaving first will ask the robot to carry his/her bag to the cab and points to the bag while requesting.
	
	\item \textbf{Bag Location:} The bag will be placed at a designated position.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Additional rules and remarks}
\begin{enumerate}[nosep]
	\item \textbf{Deus ex Machina:} Score reduction for requesting human assistance is applied per guest as follows.
	\begin{enumerate}[nosep]
		\item \textbf{Indicating leaving guest:} Telling the robot which guest is leaving (e.g. verbally or pointing at her) causes a reduction of 10\% in scoring for that particular guest.

		\item \textbf{Guiding to the cab location:} Guiding the robot where the Cab Driver is standing causes a reduction of 40\% in scoring for that particular guest.

		\item \textbf{Guiding back to the house:} Guiding the robot back to the house causes a reduction of 40\% in scoring for that particular guest.

		\item \textbf{Bag Handover:} 50\% reduction if robot requests for help to carry the bag.
	\end{enumerate}

	\item \textbf{Kicking out guests:} Non-calling guests will refuse to leave the house. The robot must confirm that the guest was calling and willing to leave.
	
	\item \textbf{Identifying the Cab:} There will be no cab, taxi, or any other vehicle parked outside the arena.
	The cab location is identifiable by the \emph{Cab Driver}.

	\item \textbf{Cab Driver:} The cab driver is an unknown person waving, wearing high-visibility clothing (e.g., fluorescent vest).
	The distance between the cab driver and the arena cannot exceed 15m.
