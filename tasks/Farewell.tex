\section{Farewell [Party Host]}
Some guests are tired, so they call the robot to retrieve their coat.
It's raining outside and there is only one umbrella, so the robot takes the guests one by one to their cab and returns with the umbrella.

% \subsection*{Focus}
% This test focuses on human detection and recognition, safe navigation and human-robot interaction with unknown people.

\subsection*{Main Goal}
The robot escorts two tired guests to their cab (where the cab driver is standing).
\noindent\textbf{Reward:} 600pts (300pts per guest).

\subsection*{Bonus rewards}
\begin{enumerate}[nosep]
	\item Delivering guest's right coat (150pts each, max 300pts)
	\item Identifying the female guest and escorting her first (100pts)
\end{enumerate}


\subsection*{Setup}
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Location}: The test takes place inside and outside the arena.

	\item \textbf{Start Location}: The robot starts inside the arena.

	\item \textbf{Guests}: There are five people in the living room, three sitting and two standing. At least two of them are female.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Additional rules and remarks}
\begin{enumerate}[nosep]
	\item \textbf{Partial scoring:} The main task allows partial (per guest) scoring.

	\item \textbf{Guests}: All guests have a name and coat color assigned.

	\item \textbf{Calling the robot}: Guests willing to leave call the robot (e.g.~waving, shouting) simultaneously.

	\item \textbf{Deus ex Machina:} Score reduction is applied per guest as follows.
	\begin{enumerate}[nosep]
		\item \textbf{Indicating leaving guest:} Telling the robot which guest is leaving (e.g.~pointing) causes 30pts of score reduction.

		\item \textbf{Guiding to the cab location:} Guiding the robot to the cab causes 40pts of score reduction.

		\item \textbf{Guiding back to the house:} Guiding the robot back to the arena causes 40pts of score reduction.

		\item \textbf{Coat handover:} Handing over a coat to the robot (i.e.~no hook off) reduces the bonus to 50pts.
	\end{enumerate}

	\item \textbf{Kicking out guests:} Non-calling guests will refuse to leave the house. The robot must confirm that the guest was calling and willing to leave.

	\item \textbf{Cab/Taxi:} The cab location is identifiable by a \emph{Cab Driver} wearing high-visibility clothing (e.g.~fluorescent vest) and standing under an open umbrella.
	No vehicle is intended to be parked there.
	The distance to cab driver cannot exceed 15m.

	\item \textbf{Delivering coats:} Coats are hanging on a coat rack near the exit door.
	The robot must hook off the coats autonomously, and bring them back to the right person.
\end{enumerate}
