\section{Carry My Luggage [Party Host]}
\label{test:carry-my-luggage}
The robot helps the operator to carry their luggage to a car which is parked outside.

% \subsection*{Focus}
% Object identification and manipulation, person-following, and social navigation.

\subsection*{Main Goal}
The robot helps the operator to carry a bag to a location outside the arena.

\noindent\textbf{Reward:} 500pts.

\subsection*{Bonus rewards}
\begin{enumerate}[nosep]
	\item Reentering the arena (100 pts).
	\item Avoid all obstacles (400 pts, 100pts per obstacle).
\end{enumerate}


\subsection*{Setup}
\begin{itemize}[nosep]
	\item \textbf{Location}: The test takes place inside and outside the arena.

	\item \textbf{Start Location}: The robot starts at a predefined location.

	\item \textbf{Bags:} At least two bags (see \ref{rule:scenario_objects_list}) are placed near the operator, visible to the robot.

	\item \textbf{Operator}: The operator is standing in front of the robot pointing at the bag to be carried out.

\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Additional rules and remarks}
\begin{enumerate}[nosep]
	\item \textbf{Deus ex Machina:} Score reduction for requesting human assistance is applied as follows.
	\begin{itemize}[nosep]
		\item Handing the bag over (-100 pts).
		\item Finding the operator while following them:
		\begin{itemize}[nosep]
		\item Natural interaction (e.g.~wave and calling) 100pts score reduction.
		\item Non-natural interaction (e.g.~raising both hands and jumping) 200pts score reduction.
		\item Moving back (e.g.~ask the operator to step back in front of the robot) 300pts score reduction.
		\item Touching the robot (e.g.~pulling the robot's hand) 400pts score reduction.
		\end{itemize}
	\end{itemize}

	\item \textbf{Obstacles:} The robot will face 4 obstacles along its way in any order:
	\begin{enumerate*}[label=(\alph*)]
		\item a crowd obstructing path,
		\item a small object on the ground,
		\item a hard-to-see 3D object,
		and
		\item a small area blocked using retractable barriers. Teams can choose to have no obstacles placed if they do not want to go for bonus points. Teams can not pick and choose which obstacles are placed. Either none or all of them.
	\end{enumerate*}

	\item \textbf{Car Location:} A location outside the arena. Not announced before the test.

	\item \textbf{Reaching the Car:} The robot can reach the car's location only by following the operator.

	\item \textbf{Following the Operator:} The robot should indicate the operator when it is ready to follow. The operator walks naturally towards the car. After reaching the car, the operator takes the bag back from the robot and thanks the robot.

\end{enumerate}


\subsection*{Referee instructions}

The referees need to
\begin{itemize}[nosep]
	\item Select one volunteer as the operator.
	\item Select three to four people to obstruct robot's path outside.
	\item Choose bags' positions and assign a bag to the operator.
	\item Choose which obstacles the robot will face outside while following the operator.
	\item Choose the car's location.
	\item Mind the robot when it goes outside the arena.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{OC instructions}
